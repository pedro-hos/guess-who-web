# guess-who-web

This a web page project using the [guess-who-crawler](https://github.com/pedro-hos/guess-who-crawler) scrapped data and provided by the [guess-who-api](https://github.com/pedro-hos/guess-who-api) API project.

## The Who-Guess Game
The Who-Guess game is designed to be similar to a profile-based guessing game. In this game, a person is selected randomly, and players must guess who it is based on a series of clues provided one by one. The goal is to identify the selected person with as few clues as possible. You can choose individuals from any state or city in Brazil.
